* This package has been archived on 22 May 2021 because of errors in the dplyr package, causing the skimr package to fail: <https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/5881>. This AMR package contains a fix around this error. Nonetheless, an automated email sent to the maintainer with a warning that the AMR package would be archived would have saved us this archiving. Perhaps an idea for future development of CRAN?

* This package has a tarball size of over 7 MB and an installation size of over 5 MB, which will return a NOTE on R CMD CHECK. The package size is needed to offer users reference data for the complete taxonomy of microorganisms - one of the most important features of this package. This was written and explained in a manuscript that was accepted for publication in the Journal of Statistical Software 4 weeks ago. We will add the paper as a vignette in the next version. Please allow this exception in package size for CRAN. We already compressed all data sets using `compression = "xz"` to make them as small as possible.
