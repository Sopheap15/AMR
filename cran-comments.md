* This package now has a data folder size of ~2.8 MB (this was ~5.6 MB), which will return a NOTE on R CMD CHECK. The package size is needed to provide users reference data for the complete taxonomy of microorganisms - one of the most important features of this package. This was written and explained in a manuscript that was accepted for publication in the Journal of Statistical Software earlier this year. We will add the paper as a vignette after publication in a next version. All data sets were compressed using `compression = "xz"` to make them as small as possible. We try to update as infrequent as possible.
