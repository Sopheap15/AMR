* This package now has a data folder size of ~2.8 MB (this was ~5.6 MB), which will return a NOTE on R CMD CHECK. This package size is needed to provide users reference data for the complete taxonomy of microorganisms - one of the most important features of this package, following 15 previous releases of this package. All data sets were compressed using `compression = "xz"` to make them as small as possible.
